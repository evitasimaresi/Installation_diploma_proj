# Installation_diploma_proj
Welcome! This is my GitHub repository where I upload the Arduino code for my diploma project. My project is an interactive installation that uses Arduino to create a playful and educational experience for students in a school context. I want to thank Anthony Papamanolis for his guidance and support throughout this project.
